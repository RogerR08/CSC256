# Introduction
Hello, my name is Roger Rose. I am enrolled in the Computer Software and Development program at WTCC. I am trying to learn new skills and obtain a degree to make a career transition from Facilities Management to a Software Engineer role. I have enjoyed the classes that I have taken so far, but it is a lot to learn all at once.
